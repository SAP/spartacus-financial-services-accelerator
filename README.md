# Financial Services Accelerator
Financial Services Accelerator is storefront based on [Spartacus](https://github.com/SAP/spartacus) framework. This storefront is specialized for insurance and banking services and it's working with 
SAP Commerce over Commerce REST API.

# Storefront Features

Documentation about features and usage of financial services accelerator could be found [here](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/building-the-fsa-storefront-from-libraries)

# Requirements

If you are working with Financial Spartacus 1.0.x, your Angular development environment should include the following:

- [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/): **9.1** or later, < 10.0
- node.js: 10.14.1 or later, < 13.0. The most recent 12.x version is recommended.
- yarn: v1.15 or later

# Download and Installation

To get up and running with Financial Spartacus Storefront, the recommended approach is to build your storefront application from ready-made libraries. You can also clone and build from source, but upgrading is not as simple.

For complete setup instructions, see [Building the Financial Spartacus Storefront from Libraries](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-docs/building-the-fsa-storefront-from-libraries/).

# API Documentation

The FSA Spartacus API documentation is hosted here: [https://sap.github.io/spartacus-financial-services-accelerator/](https://sap.github.io/spartacus-financial-services-accelerator/)

The API documentation is versioned and is included in the **Assets** folder of each and every FSA Spartacus library. You can download the API documentation for a particular version by accessing the **Assets** folder of any FSA Spartacus library from that particular release, and then clicking on `docs.tar.gz` or `docs.zip`.


**Note:** The FSA Spartacus API is separate from the FSA Commerce OCC REST APIs that FSA Spartacus consumes.
